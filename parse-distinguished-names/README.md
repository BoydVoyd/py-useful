A very rough python script named parse_DNs.py

It opens a 2 column Excel file and looks for a list of Distinguished Names in the second column. The distinguished names are parsed into a more human readable format and dumped into a second spreadsheet.

Areas for improvement:
    1. Add comments to code.
    2. Add error
    3. Allow user to specify the column where DNs are stored.
    4. Start writing results to the first empty column instead of column 3.
